This is my very first experiment with the MacBook Touch Bar as well as MacOS app development.

The prices are spot price in USD fetched from [Coinbase API](https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2#get-spot-price) every 15 seconds.

## Why Touch Bar?

I understand the Touch Bar is intended for keyboard extension, not for information displaying. BUT, it's cool ðŸ˜Ž. That's why.
