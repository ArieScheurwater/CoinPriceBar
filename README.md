Cyptocurrency prices on MacBook Touch Bar.

Supported cryptocurrencies:

- Bitcoin
- Bitcoin Cash
- Ethereum
- Litecoin
- Ripple
- IOTA

Prices are in USD and updated every 15 seconds.

Ripple and IOTA prices are calculated by XRP/ETH price from Binance multiplied with ETH price from Coinbase.

Other prices are spot price in USD from Coinbase.

The app runs in background and can be accessed anywhere by tapping the `â‚¿` icon on the Touch Bar Control Strip.

## Why Touch Bar?

I understand the Touch Bar is intended for keyboard extension, not for information displaying. BUT, it's cool ðŸ˜Ž. That's why.
